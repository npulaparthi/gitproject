    <p>
        The developer should be very careful with recursion as it 
        can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which
        never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory
        or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion
        can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.
